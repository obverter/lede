# PART THREE: Applying your skills

# It's more Spotify data, hooray! Explore it the same way we did in class - if you see a dictionary, examine its keys. Pick a key that might be useful, then go inside. If you see a list, take a look at the first element of the list. Keep going until you find what you're looking for.

# Some parts of this one are VERY difficult, and some are easier. They aren't in order, so feel free to skip around! I also recommend going through the Little Columns tutorial a few times to make sure you're 100% on lists and dictionaries.

# 1. How many songs are there?

# 2. List the name of each song, along with its popularity.

# 3. How long would it take, in minutes, to listen to all of these songs in a row?

# 4. For each song, list every artist that worked on it.

# 5. For each song, list every musician that worked on it EXCEPT Drake

# 6. How many songs are from albums, and how many are from singles?

# 7. What percentage of these songs are marked as explicit?

# 8. I'd like to listen to one of the songs! Is there maybe a URL where I can listen to it?

# 9. What is the most popular song?

# PART THREE: Tips

# Is something a dictionary? Look at the keys! Is something a list? Look at the first one or use a for loop!

# You'll probably want to use for loops, and continually add to a variable you're using for counting or totaling, like in http://littlecolumns.com/learn/python/counting-with-loops/. But you might need to be more specific than you think: let's say I'm telling a robot to count the number of brown eggs in my egg basket. Robots are dumb, so it's important that I tell it we're starting with 0 eggs.
