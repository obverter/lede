I already built (most of) your scales for you, you just need to use them.










Be careful about your yPositionScale. Does it seem right?





















How are you going to use d3 to find those buttons?





















They need an id!











For selecing elements INSIDE OF THE GRAPHIC, you use svg.select/svg.selectAll. That's because it means "select stuff INSIDE the svg"

For selecting elements OUTSIDE OF THE GRAPHIC, you use d3.select/d3.selectAll. That's because it means "select anything that d3 can see on the whole page"























You can use classes or if statements to highlight/color, up to you!












If you're using classes, remember to reset EVERY bar before you update the highlighted bar












If you, for some reason, wanted to remove not-lowercase-letters from something, you could use

    whatever.replace(/[^a-z]*/g, '')














Are you SURE you did the height and y position correctly???









Except "low GDP countries", which will definitely be an if statement.
















If statements are pretty boring, but they can be useful inside of a function(d). This one below changes the font size of a label based on whether the city is tiny or not.

    .attr('text-size', function(d) {
        if(d.city_size == 'tiny') {
            return 10
        } else {
            reurn 20
        }
    })











Try changing the padding on your scaleBand to make things look nicer!
