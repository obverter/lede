Getting an eslint error? Can't figure out how to make things run? Wellllll, we have a package.json listing all of the dependencies, they just need to be installed.






















...you install them by running npm install in the project/homework directory


















To run the server: We used 'parcel index.html' in the beginning of class today, but Sawhorse (this template engine) has a lot more going on, so we use 'npm run start' instead. 'npm run start' is the STANDARD and you'll see it EVERYWHERE for EVERY PROJECT EVER so get used to it. Not just our things! Not just Parcel things! All things ever!

















Make sure you check the port it's running on - localhost:1234 is the default, but if you forgot to turn off one of your earlier servers it might be on another URL.
















All of the files you'll be editing are in the src/ folder. The handlebars templates are in src/html/, the JavaScript is in src/scripts/, and the CSS is in src/styles (not that you'll need to edit them).














You can take a look at src/index.hbs to see where other files you're interested in might be located.
