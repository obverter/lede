    "> Axel Dreher et al. have published person-level data on 2.5+ million refugees who arrived in the US between 1975 and 2008. The anonymized records, obtained from the National Archives and originally collected by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, indicate each refugee’s country and date of birth, marital and family status, education level and English proficiency, date of US arrival, US city of resettlement, and more. The researchers also combined these records with public reports from the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (DIP 2015.11.25) to create a geocoded dataset of annual resettlements by citizenship and destination city from 1975 to 2018.\n",
