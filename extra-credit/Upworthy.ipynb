    "> The Upworthy Research Archive describes 32,000+ headline-testing experiments conducted in 2013â€“15 by Upworthy, the online publication that popularized a once-ubiquitous style of headline. The dataset, contributed by the publication to a team of academics, is split into three tranches for use in different phases of research. In total, it covers 150,000+ headline-plus-image permutations; for each, it provides the headline, an image identifier, the number of viewers assigned to see it, the number who clicked, and other details.\n",
